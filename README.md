### 3. Election-Audit Summary:
    This script can be modified to work for any election in tallying votes. Our lists and dictionaries do not have any specific names; we are determining candidates & counties by the row they are in on the csv file. As long as we have our csv file rows matched up to the code, we can essentially plug and play with any election across the world.
